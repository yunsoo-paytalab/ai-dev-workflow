# `/workflow-domain-definition` Command

**When to use**: When defining domain and features

**Features**:

- Set domain list and boundaries
- Define page structure
- Derive feature list
- (Optional) Analyze feature dependencies

**Recommendations**:

- Perform first at project start

**Usage**:

```
/workflow-domain-definition
```

---

## Goal

Analyze requirements specification to set domain boundaries and define page-level structure.
Optionally, analyze dependencies between features to derive optimal implementation order.

---

### Step 1: Check Requirements Specification

1. Read `docs/workflows/memory.md` - Understand current progress
2. Check if requirements specification exists

**If requirements specification is not available**:

- üìÑ Request requirements specification file attachment (`docs/requirements.md`)
- üìã Request existing system documentation attachment
- üí¨ Request direct requirements explanation in chat

‚ö†Ô∏è Wait for requirements to be provided before proceeding (proceeding is possible)

---

### Step 2: Analyze Requirements

**Work content**:

1. Analyze requirements specification
2. Extract core features
3. Identify main actors (user types)
4. Understand data flow

---

### Step 3: Identify Domain Boundaries

#### Domain Boundary Decision Guide

**Basic principles**:

1. **Actor-centric**: If main actor is clear, include in that domain
2. **Simplicity first**: Don't separate if not complex
3. **Change isolation**: Consider separating frequently changing logic
4. **Cohesion**: Related features belong in the same domain

#### Decision Criteria (Check in order)

For each feature:

**1. Is the main actor clear?**

- YES ‚Üí Consider including in that domain
- NO ‚Üí Next step

**2. Are business rules complex?**

- YES ‚Üí Consider separating into separate domain
- NO ‚Üí Include in main domain

**3. Does it integrate with 3 or more domains?**

- YES ‚Üí Separate into different domain
- NO ‚Üí Include in main domain

**4. Is it frequently changed?** (Monthly or more)

- YES ‚Üí Consider separating into separate domain
- NO ‚Üí Include in main domain

#### Decision Examples

**Example 1 - Include in main domain**:

- Case: User notification settings
- Main actor: User ‚úì
- Complexity: Low (boolean flag)
- Related domains: 1
- **Conclusion**: Include in User domain

**Example 2 - Separate into different domain**:

- Case: Points/reward system
- Main actor: Unclear (User, Order, Review all involved)
- Complexity: High (accumulation/usage/expiration rules)
- Related domains: 4 or more
- Change frequency: High
- **Conclusion**: Separate as Reward domain

---

### Step 4: Define Page Structure

**Work content**:

1. Identify all necessary pages
2. Design URL paths for each page
3. Display related domain for each page
4. Define routing structure (authentication requirements, etc.)

**Notes**:

- ‚úÖ Define only at page level
- ‚úÖ Design only URL structure and routing
- ‚ùå Define detailed components within pages during UI design phase

---

### Step 5: Derive Feature List

For each feature, derive the following information:

- **Feature name**: Clear and specific
- **Primary domain** (primaryDomain): Owner of this feature
- **Related domains** (relatedDomains): Domains it integrates with
- **Complexity**: low / moderate / high
- **Description**: Brief description

**Cases requiring discussion**:

- When primary domain is unclear
- When multiple domain placement options exist
- When it's ambiguous whether to separate into different domain

In these cases, mark as `needsDiscussion: true` and suggest placement options

---

### Step 6: Identify Resources

Identify only major data resources:

- Examples: User, Product, Order, Review, Payment

**Notes**:

- ‚úÖ List only resource names
- ‚ùå Define API endpoints during implementation phase

---

## Step 7: Feature Planning (Optional)

> üí° **Optional step**: Use only in complex projects

> **Simple projects**: Can skip this section

### 7-1. Check if Feature Implementation Order is Needed

#### üîî User input required

"Would you like to analyze dependencies between features and organize the implementation order?"

- [ ] **Yes** - Proceed with dependency analysis
- [ ] **No** - Developer decides order directly (go to Step 11)

**If "No" is selected**: Skip directly to Step 11

**If "Yes" is selected**: Proceed below

---

### 7-2. Generate Dependency Graph

**AI work**: Analyze dependencies between features

**Dependency types**:

- Direct dependency: Feature A explicitly uses Feature B
- Data dependency: Result of Feature A is input to Feature B
- UI dependency: Component A includes Component B

**Examples**:

- F001 (Product list) ‚Üí F002 (Add to cart)
- F002 (Add to cart) ‚Üí F005 (Place order)
- F003 (Login) ‚Üí F004 (My page)

---

### 7-3. Topological Sort

Sort in dependency order:

1. Features with no dependencies first
2. In order of resolved dependencies
3. Group features that can be parallelized

**Example result**:

- Group 1 (can be parallelized): F001, F003
- Group 2 (after F001 completed): F002, F006
- Group 3 (after F003 completed): F004
- Group 4 (after F002 completed): F005

---

### 7-4. Detect and Resolve Circular Dependencies

**When circular dependencies are found**:

#### üîî User confirmation needed

"‚ö†Ô∏è Circular dependency detected:"

**Display circular path**:

```
F002 (Add to cart) ‚Üí F005 (Place order) ‚Üí F002 (Modify cart)
```

**Present resolution options**:

1. **Extract common module** (Recommended): Extract common logic of circularly dependent features into separate module
2. **Merge features**: Merge circularly dependent features into one large feature
3. **Remove dependency**: Remove/modify some features in circular dependency
4. **Redesign needed**: Domain boundaries need to be reset

"Which option would you choose?"

**After user selection**:

- Reorganize feature list
- Regenerate dependency graph
- Re-run topological sort
- Record decision in Memory file

---

### 7-5. Propose and Approve Implementation Order

#### üîî User review needed

"I plan to implement features in the following order:"

**Implementation order**:

- Group 1 (can be parallelized): F001, F003
- Group 2 (after F001 completed): F002, F006
- Group 3 (after F003 completed): F004
- ...

**Review recommended**:

- Are dependencies correctly understood?
- Is the order logical?
- Are parallelizable features correctly grouped?

**Feedback**: (Implement immediately if modification needed)

---

## Step 8: Overall Review

### Review Guide (For AI)

**Basic principle**: Ask questions flexibly according to project complexity

**Always ask**:

- Does the domain structure match requirements?
- Is the feature list complete?

**Conditional questions**:

- Many domains (5 or more): Are domain boundaries clear?
- Many pages (10 or more): Is routing structure intuitive?
- If feature planning was performed: Is dependency analysis appropriate?
- If tech stack was suggested: Is the choice reasonable?

**Question style**:

- Prefer open-ended questions
- Specifically point out issues when found
- Present alternatives

#### üîî User review

**Result summary**:

**Domain list**:

- [Domain1]: [Description]
- [Domain2]: [Description]

**After domain definition is completed**:

- Recommended: `/workflow-common-ui` (Common UI design)
- Or: `/workflow-ui [feature-name]` (Feature UI design)
